Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Vulnerabilities in the operating systems that customers install inside EC2 instances.
Vulnerabilities in individual applications that you deploy on EC2.
Network configuration mistakes.
Weak access controls in your AWS account.
Overly permissive Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings may make it easier for attackers
or malicious insiders to modify EC2 instance configurations or change the workloads running on EC2.
In most cases, VMs hosted on EC2 store persistent data using Amazon EBS, a block storage service.
Oversights in the way EBS is configured – such as forgetting to encrypt EBS volumes, 
which are not generally encrypted by default – could expose sensitive data to attack.
(To be clear, EBS is a separate service from EC2, so insecure storage settings aren’t a risk to EC2 per se; 
nonetheless, since EBS and EC2 go hand-in-hand, 
weak security for EBS often translates to security issues for any workloads hosted on EC2.)
EC2 instances can be vulnerable to attacks through a variety of vectors.


AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda handles the infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance, allowing you to focus on your application's functionality.
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code in response to events without managing servers.
Here's a simple scenario to illustrate its use:
Scenario: Automatic Image Resizing

Imagine you have a website where users upload images. You want these images to be automatically resized to create thumbnails for previews. Manually resizing each image would be time-consuming and inefficient. With AWS Lambda, you can automate this process:

User Uploads an Image: A user uploads an image to an Amazon S3 bucket.

Trigger Lambda Function: The upload event triggers an AWS Lambda function.

Process the Image: The Lambda function resizes the image to create a thumbnail.

Store the Thumbnail: The resized image is saved back to the S3 bucket.

Display on Website: The website uses the thumbnail for previews.

Ensure all data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Utilize client-side encryption or SSL/TLS for secure data transmission to and from S3.
Data stored on S3 should always be encrypted to safeguard it from unauthorized access.



cloud watch logs,
Focus:

CloudWatch is centered on real-time monitoring and operational performance.
CloudTrail is centered on recording and auditing API calls and user activities.
Data Collection:

CloudWatch collects metrics and logs from AWS services and applications.
CloudTrail records API calls and user activities within your AWS account.

CloudWatch is used for performance monitoring, setting alarms, and visualizing logs.
CloudTrail is used for auditing, security analysis, and compliance reporting.

vpc flow logs,
Amazon VPC Flow Logs
Captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC),
aiding in network monitoring and security analysis.

Security Best Practices:

Use customer-managed keys for granular control.

Regularly rotate encryption keys.

Use key policies to restrict access.

What it is: Store and manage secrets.

Security Best Practices:

Use IAM policies to control access.
