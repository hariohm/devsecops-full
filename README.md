In AWS security, organizations primarily focus on securing the 15-20 core services that are widely used, covering IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS model.
These services, including IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, EKS, ECS, VPC, CloudTrail, and Security Hub, must be evaluated for security misconfigurations, access control, encryption, and compliance. Security validation is performed across three areas: pentesting, where manual and automated vulnerability assessments help identify misconfigurations and weaknesses; DevSecOps, where automated security integration in CI/CD ensures secure deployments; and application security, which focuses on securing APIs, web applications, and protecting against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Additionally, cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools such as Scout Suite are used to continuously monitor misconfigurations across cloud services, ensuring compliance with security standards.
Once cloud security is in place, the next critical area is code security, which begins when developers commit or push code to repositories like GitHub or GitLab. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is conducted using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, and Trivy to identify vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies. These tools help detect outdated libraries, transitive vulnerabilities, and package security issues, ensuring that applications do not depend on insecure third-party components. The mitigation process involves updating outdated libraries, applying security patches, and replacing vulnerable dependencies with safer alternatives. Following SCA, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed using SonarQube, Semgrep, Snyk, and Checkmarx to analyze the source code for security flaws such as SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, and insecure cryptography. Along with SAST, secret scanning is performed using GitLeaks to detect API keys, passwords, and sensitive credentials that may have been inadvertently committed to repositories. Since these security checks are primarily developer-driven, the DevSecOps team ensures enforcement through automated security policies but does not modify the code itself.
The next phase involves Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), which tests the application in a running state to detect real-world vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, broken authentication, and security misconfigurations. This can be done manually or automatically using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Nessus. DAST scans help uncover security flaws that may not be visible in static code analysis, providing a more comprehensive security assessment. If code quality or security gates fail due to a low security score (below 75 or 100%), the development team must rework the code before it proceeds further. This automated security enforcement ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed before deployment without requiring manual intervention from security teams.
In modern cloud environments, container security is equally crucial. Container and image scanning are conducted to check for vulnerabilities in Docker builds, Kubernetes manifests, and deployed container images. Trivy, Kube-bench, and Grype are commonly used tools to scan for CVEs, ensure Kubernetes compliance, and detect security misconfigurations. Issues such as running containers as root, exposed ports, and the use of outdated base images are mitigated by implementing non-root users, restricting ingress traffic, and using secure base images. Container security extends beyond static scans to runtime security, ensuring that vulnerabilities are not only detected pre-deployment but also monitored in production.
Beyond DevSecOps, application security (AppSec) plays a critical role in ensuring that products are protected against vulnerabilities such as those listed in the OWASP Top 10. Application security testing includes manual penetration testing using Burp Suite, Nikto, and OWASP ZAP to uncover business logic vulnerabilities, insecure authentication, and API flaws. If possible, threat modeling is performed before infrastructure security implementation to proactively identify risks. From a pentesterâ€™s perspective, threat modeling involves asset inventory to determine what needs protection, identifying threat actors who may target the system, and analyzing threat vectors to assess potential attack paths. This approach ensures a risk-based security strategy that aligns with both business needs and security best practices.
As a SOC analyst, my role involves continuously monitoring and analyzing server logs to detect and respond to security incidents in real time. Security logging and monitoring are essential to identifying threats such as brute-force attempts, unauthorized access, and anomalous behavior across cloud and on-premises environments. AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, ELK Stack, and Splunk are used for centralized log monitoring, enabling rapid detection and response to potential threats. In addition to log analysis, organizations implement SIEM solutions to aggregate security events, detect patterns, and automate incident response. 
Other essential security practices include Zero Trust security implementations using IAM role segmentation, BeyondCorp, and network segmentation strategies to minimize attack surfaces. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) principles are enforced throughout the development process by integrating security testing at every stage, from code commit to production deployment. Security in CI/CD pipelines is automated using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins to enforce security compliance at each step. Furthermore, red team vs. blue team exercises help simulate attack scenarios, allowing organizations to test their incident response readiness. 
In summary, a well-structured security approach should cover AWS cloud security, secure coding practices, DevSecOps automation, container security, application security, threat modeling, and continuous security monitoring. This strategy applies universally across organizations, ensuring a robust security posture for cloud environments, codebases, and applications.
